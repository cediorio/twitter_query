How Blockchain Technology Is Transforming the Legal Industry,https://biglawbusiness.com/how-blockchain-technology-is-transforming-the-legal-industry/,"smart contracts, blockchain","""OpenLaw provides templates for lawyers to generate legal documents. In the contracting realm, it is incorporating a function that would allow two parties to a contract to negotiate by marking up previous drafts. Once the contract is finalized, it gathers signatures from both parties and stores the signatures on the blockchain. Lawyers can also embed self-executing smart contracts in those agreements, which can be used to transfer value, or pay employees in real time, Wright said.

Although there are individual services focused on each step in the process, blockchain is the only thing that can connect all these pieces together, Wright said. The product is in private testing phase and will be offered to the public for free.
An implication of a tool like OpenLaw is that “a lot of the scut work lawyers do on a day-to-day basis will presumably go down over time,” Wright said. Joe Dewey, who is developing a similar platform called ContractCode, agrees. Dewey is partner and leader of real estate practice group of Holland & Knight. An impact of smart contract is that clients will push the legal industry toward more standardization, which will in turn create more efficiency, Dewey said.""",""
